The framework implements state-of-the-art numerical methods including high-order WENO schemes, TVD Runge-Kutta methods, and adaptive IMEX approaches. **For Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problems specifically**, the framework achieves unprecedented computational efficiency through ultra-high performance SIMD vectorization and advanced OpenMP parallelization strategies.

## Mathematical Framework

CASL-HJX provides a unified computational platform for multiple classes of partial differential equations:

### 1. Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equations (with High-Performance Optimization)

The framework solves the general HJB equation for optimal control problems:

```
∂V/∂t + H(x, ∇V, t) = 0,  x ∈ Ω ⊂ ℝⁿ, t ∈ [0,T]
V(x,T) = g(x)
```

where:
- **V(x,t)**: Value function (cost-to-go)
- **H(x,p,t)**: Hamiltonian function
- **Ω**: Spatial domain with appropriate boundary conditions
- **g(x)**: Terminal cost function

**Note**: Ultra-high performance SIMD optimizations (ARM NEON, AVX2) and advanced parallelization strategies are specifically implemented for HJB/LQR solvers within this framework.

### 2. Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) Specialization

For the LQR problem with system dynamics **ẋ = Ax + Bu** and quadratic cost, the Hamiltonian takes the form:

```
H(x,p) = ½|Ax + BB^T p|² + ½x^T Qx + ½p^T Rp
```

The optimal control policy is given by **u*(x,t) = -R⁻¹B^T∇V(x,t)**. This solver features the most aggressive performance optimizations in the framework.

### 3. Additional PDE Types (Standard Performance)

The framework additionally handles various transport and diffusion phenomena:

- **Linear Advection**: ∂φ/∂t + c·∇φ = 0
- **Nonlinear Burgers**: ∂u/∂t + u·∇u = ν∇²u  
- **Advection-Diffusion**: ∂u/∂t + c·∇u = D∇²u
- **Heat/Diffusion**: ∂u/∂t = α∇²u
- **Level-Set Methods**: For front propagation and interface tracking
